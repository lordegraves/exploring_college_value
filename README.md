# Exploring College Value

## Overview
This project explores the value of colleges based on tuition costs, average graduate earnings, and other key performance indicators. The goal is to analyze the relationship between college costs and graduate success, and to identify institutions that provide the best value for students. The project was completed as part of a Module 16 data analysis challenge.

## Files
- `college_value_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, cleaning, and analysis.
- `Resources/` — Folder containing the input dataset.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing to clean and structure the dataset.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and insights.
- Visualization of the relationship between tuition costs, graduate earnings, and other metrics.
- Identification of top-performing colleges based on cost-to-earnings ratios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `college_value_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and clean the college value dataset.
   - Analyze key trends and relationships.
   - Visualize insights through charts and graphs.
5. Use findings to understand which institutions provide the best financial return on investment.
